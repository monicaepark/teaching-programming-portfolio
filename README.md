# Teaching Programming Portfolio

This repository was created to showcase the projects I've created to teach programming to beginners. All projects are inspired from the UCSD EDS 124BR (Teaching Computational Thinking for Everyone) course curriculum, which I took over the summer of 2024 with Dr. Amy Eguchi and Dr. Beth Simon.

## Module 1: (Course Orientation)

## Module 2-3: Computational Thinking and Sequencing
Exercise: [Show What You Know: Explain Your Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjNx8lQaYlel7A3gLto-HLlDvkDts2Yp/view?usp=sharing) | 'Snap'

In this exercise, students will explain their own code step by step through a video, highlighting 1) the purpose of their code, and 2) what happens when the code runs. This exercise helps educators to see if their student understands how their code works.

## Module 4-5: Repeats
Exercise: [Let's dance!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Ps4hDjKPVM__x40imGJtkPKZB6iAUx6/view?usp=sharing) | 'Snap'

Here, students will use the concept of repeats to emulate a breakdancer's dance using [these](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bqlijPZWJLNByw8xqjSNAwBiC_wigLFMJ59T49YgYMQ/edit#slide=id.p) step by step instructions. If students want to explore further, they can write their own program using the concept of repeats.


Exercise: [Animal Parade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bF6SyrSvgg9mY5MahdOElxH0GNinjiu2/view?usp=sharing) | 'Scratch'

In this exercise, students will play with animal spites on scratch using [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/428258614/) starter code along to this [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/111ar9NiouOq5KzZDPYm6z3_6yi_A3aPdou49fr_sABI/edit#slide=id.g40f3bba36c_0_157). Students will create repeat blocks for the kangaroo, grasshopperm and bee sprites to practice using repeat blocks to automate processes in their code.

## Module 6: Equity & Pedagogy

## Module 7-8: Nested Repeats
Exercise: [Mouse's Octagon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fj6Bwaphx_2KgJzQifOrBtZLs9oRNzdk/view?usp=sharing) | 'Snap'

Now, we'll explore "nested" repeats ([tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13bEzhRNj80CD0LC7Wvi87OAp5uDGmugU0FjsnCYC4Pc/edit#slide=id.p)), where we place a repeat block inside another repeat block (aka nested loops). In effect, we are repeating a set of instructions that already contains at least one repeating set of instructions.

## Module 8-9: Events
Exercise: [Catch the bananas!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRQwIL9-sRhcreVtnHnoPkT4M0of2Dfu/view?usp=sharing) | 'Snap'

The next concept is events. We want our program ([tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tbNxOKTPL_YlmywncLeoagH0eIMmeTNu5tCHpnrTeJI/edit)) to interact with real life "events" that will signal the next sequence of events, such as moving left when the left key is pressed, or waving when another character says hello. We will create these events using the "broadcast..." (send a signal) and "when I receive..." (receive a signal) blocks in snap.
