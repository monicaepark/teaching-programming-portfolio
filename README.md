# Teaching Programming Portfolio

This repository was created to showcase the projects I've created to teach programming to beginners. All projects are inspired from the UCSD EDS 124BR (Teaching Computational Thinking for Everyone) course curriculum, which I took over the summer of 2024 with Dr. Amy Eguchi and Dr. Beth Simon.

## Module 3: Computational Thinking and Sequencing
Exercise: [Show What You Know: Explain Your Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjNx8lQaYlel7A3gLto-HLlDvkDts2Yp/view?usp=sharing)

In this exercise, students will explain their own code step by step through a video, highlighting 1) the purpose of their code, and 2) what happens when the code runs. This exercise helps educators to see if their student understands how their code works.
